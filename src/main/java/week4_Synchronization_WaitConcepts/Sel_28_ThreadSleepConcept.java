// To use synchronizationsa is more professional way from Selenium instead of Thread.sleep.
// Thread.sleep doesnâ€™t guarantee that it will work.
// If we use Thread.sleep(5000), we need to state that it would take longer than 5 seconds to load, 
// So that the script does not run, no assurances are provided for the element to appear
// within a fixed period to wait.
